# Working Genius Framework

Welcome to the Working Genius Framework repository! This project provides resources for implementing Patrick Lencioni's "Working Genius" model across different target groups and contexts.

## About Working Genius

The Working Genius model identifies six different types of work that must be done for any team or organization to thrive:

- **Wonder** - The natural gift of pondering the possibility of greater potential and opportunity
- **Invention** - The natural gift of creating original and novel ideas and solutions
- **Discernment** - The natural gift of instinctively evaluating ideas and situations
- **Galvanizing** - The natural gift of rallying and inspiring people to take action
- **Enablement** - The natural gift of providing encouragement and assistance for an idea or project
- **Tenacity** - The natural gift of pushing projects to completion and ensuring that work gets done

Each person naturally excels in two of these areas (their "Genius"), is capable but must exert more effort in two (their "Competency"), and finds two areas draining and frustrating (their "Frustration").
