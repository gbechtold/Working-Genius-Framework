# Working Genius: Prompt Collection for Different Target Groups

## Context and Goal

```markdown
Create a questionnaire based on Patrick Lencioni's "Working Genius" model, which identifies six different work types: Wonder, Invention, Discernment, Galvanizing, Enablement, and Tenacity. The questionnaire should identify a person's natural inclinations and strengths in these six areas without the categories being recognizable in advance to avoid biases. The evaluation at the end should show in which two areas the person is strongest (Working Genius), in which two they are competent (Working Competency), and which two may be frustrating for them (Working Frustration).

## Prompt for a Concealed Adult Questionnaire

```markdown
Create a neutral self-assessment questionnaire for adults that captures the six Working Genius types (Wonder, Invention, Discernment, Galvanizing, Enablement, Tenacity) without directly naming the categories. The questionnaire should:

1. Designate the six categories as neutral "sections"
2. Contain 5 questions per category that capture typical behaviors and preferences of the respective types
3. Use a 5-point rating scale (1 = Does not apply at all to 5 = Fully applies)
4. Be professionally and objectively worded
5. Include an evaluation method at the end that only reveals the categories there
6. Avoid allowing participants to recognize which type a question is assigned to

The questions should be focused on work situations, teamwork, and professional preferences, and capture typical behaviors of the six types in a professional environment.

## Prompt for a Concealed Youth Questionnaire (Crazy)

```markdown
Create a cool, energetic self-assessment questionnaire for teenagers (13-18 years) that captures the six Working Genius types, but in a crazy, trendy way. The questionnaire should:

1. Have a creative, surprising title that appeals to teenagers (e.g., "What's Your Brain Power?")
2. Mask the categories with crazy names (e.g., instead of "Sections 1-6," creative names like "Cosmic Brain," "Idea Explosion," etc.)
3. Use youth-appropriate language with slang and trendy expressions
4. Contain 5 questions per category that relate to typical situations in school and leisure contexts of teenagers
5. Have a cool rating scale (e.g., "No Way" to "Totally Me")
6. Incorporate emojis and visual elements in the description
7. Offer a humorous but informative evaluation at the end

The questions should be concealed so that it is not recognizable which category they measure, but at the same time be relevant to the respective Working Genius types and relate to the life of teenagers (social media, school, circle of friends, hobbies).
```

## Prompt for a Concealed Children's Questionnaire (Playful)

```markdown
Create a playful, easy-to-understand questionnaire for children (7-12 years) that captures the six Working Genius types in a child-friendly form. The questionnaire should:

1. Have an imaginative title that speaks of "superpowers" or "special abilities"
2. Mask the six categories as child-friendly concepts (e.g., "Thinker," "Inventor," "Explorer" instead of the original terms)
3. Use a simplified 3-point scale with emojis (üòï = No, üòê = Sometimes, üòÉ = Yes)
4. Contain 5 simple, concrete questions per category that relate to everyday situations of children (school, play, family, friends)
5. Use clear, short sentences without complicated words
6. Offer a positive, encouraging wording for all types
7. Include a very simple evaluation method (e.g., counting the smiling faces)

The questionnaire should be colorful and motivating and help children discover their natural strengths without forcing them into categories. The wording should be positive and convey that each "superpower" is valuable.

## Prompt for the Evaluation of the Questionnaires

```markdown
Create an evaluation system for the Working Genius questionnaires that includes the following elements:

1. Clear instructions for calculating the scores for each of the six categories
2. A method for identifying the two strongest areas (Working Genius), the two middle areas (Working Competency), and the two weakest areas (Working Frustration)
3. A detailed description of each of the six categories with:
   - Core characteristics and typical behaviors
   - Strengths and positive contributions to the team
   - Potential challenges or blind spots
   - Optimal working conditions for this type
4. An explanation of how the different combinations of Working Genius types can complement each other
5. Specific recommendations for each of the 15 possible Genius combinations (e.g., Wonder + Invention, Wonder + Discernment, etc.)
6. A visual representation option for the results (e.g., radar chart or other diagram form)

The evaluation should be helpful both at the individual level (self-understanding, career development) and at the team level (how the different types can work together).
```

## Prompt for the Evaluation with Action Recommendations in SMART Format

```markdown
Based on the results of the Working Genius questionnaire, create a comprehensive overall picture with personalized action recommendations. The document should contain the following elements:

1. A visual summary of the identified Working Genius types (the 2 strongest), Working Competency types (the 2 middle ones), and Working Frustration types (the 2 weakest)

2. A personal strength profile that highlights the natural talents and abilities based on the Working Genius types

3. An analysis of the optimal working conditions and task types for this specific combination of strengths

4. 10 concrete action recommendations in SMART format (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) that:
   - 4 recommendations for maximizing the identified Working Genius areas
   - 3 recommendations for improving the Working Competency areas
   - 3 strategies for dealing with the Working Frustration areas

5. A structured action plan with concrete, immediately implementable todos for the next 30, 60, and 90 days, with each todo:
   - Containing a clear, specific goal
   - Defining measurable success criteria
   - Setting a realistic timeframe
   - Explaining the expected benefit for personal and professional development
   - Considering how it fits with the identified Working Genius types

The action recommendations and todos should be personalized and tailored to the specific combination of Working Genius types, as well as consider practical applications in professional and private life.
